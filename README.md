# Cubiks

A port of the [Cubiks](https://github.com/jonot-cyber/cubiks) project to TypeScript. I made this because hosting costs money and github pages is free.

## FAQ

### Shouldn't this be called Cubiks.ts?
Shut up.

### Aren't there other websites that do this?
Yes, but I wanted to make my own.

### But you didn't even put it on github pages
I know, I'm lazy. I'll do it later. Maybe. Probably not

### Nobody asked you any of these questions, you're just making them up
I don't care

## Usage

`pnpm run build`
